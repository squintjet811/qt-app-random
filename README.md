# qt-app-random

This is going to be my first Qt open source project for developing apps. It will serve as a basic framework to hook up with a qml frontend and c++ backend application which could be deployed using CMakeList accross different platforms.


## Build
You can clone the package and build with CMakelist in qtcreator. Currently the only dependencies is qt version should be greater than 5.12(I am using qt 5.13).

### First Stage
#### I will implement a basic login page which is similar to what I have done in my previous company. What will be different is there the login information will be saved into a database. 
Progress: 70% <br/>
Expected delivery: 10-Jan-2020 <br/>
Currently Login Interface:<br/>

#### I will implement some interesting features to work
