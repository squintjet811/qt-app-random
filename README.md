# qt-app-random

This is going to be my first Qt open source project for developing apps. It will serve as a basic framework to hook up with a qml frontend and c++ backend application which could be deployed using CMakeList accross different platforms.

## First Stage
#### I will implement a basic login page which is similar to what I have done in my previous company.

## Second Stage
#### I will add more front-end qml elements to make the app visually appealing
